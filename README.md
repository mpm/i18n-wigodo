# I18nWigodo (I18n with Google Docs)

This gem offers a simple way of having cloud stored translations for
your Rails app.

Just create a new spreadsheet in Google Docs and make it world readable.
This makes integration of the gem easier since no credentials and
authentication mechanisms for Google are needed.

If this is a security concern for you, either this gem is not for you,
or you can revoke public read access to the document whenever you are
not syncing your translations.

You can share your document with write access to your translator.

To fetch new translations, run

```sh
rake wigodo:fetch
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'i18n_wigodo'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install i18n-wigodo

## Configuration

The spreadsheet file is either identified by the URL or directly via the
`document_id`.

There is an [example file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1en5BoKGaAqO9_BRSQ9CQKkvwrYQWNBUPjgSzxyn83Pc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) showing how the columns should be laid out.
The `document_id` of this file is the part between `d/` and `/edit`: `1en5BoKGaAqO9_BRSQ9CQKkvwrYQWNBUPjgSzxyn83Pc`.

You have two options to set this:

### Initializer (recommended)

After the gem is loaded from a Rails app, you can use the install
generator to create the initializer file:

```sh
bin/rails wigodo:install --url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1en5BoKGaAqO9_BRSQ9CQKkvwrYQWNBUPjgSzxyn83Pc/edit?gid=0#gid=0"
```

This will create `config/initializers/wigodo.rb` inside your Rails
project and store the URL to the translations document.
The `--url` parameter is optional, though.

Alternatively, create the initializer file manually:

Add `config/initializers/wigodo.rb`

```Ruby
I18nWigodo.configure do |config|
  config.document_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1en5BoKGaAqO9_BRSQ9CQKkvwrYQWNBUPjgSzxyn83Pc/edit?gid=0#gid=0"

  # Or just provide the document_id
  # config.document_id = "1en5BoKGaAqO9_BRSQ9CQKkvwrYQWNBUPjgSzxyn83Pc"
end
```

### YAML files (deprecated)

Rails will read the config from `config/credentials.yml` or
`config/secrets.yml`

Add a key `wigodo_doc_id` containing the `document_id`.
Just storing the URL directly is not supported with this method.

Example:

```yaml
wigodo_doc_id: 1en5BoKGaAqO9_BRSQ9CQKkvwrYQWNBUPjgSzxyn83Pc
```

## Usage

### 

```sh
rake wigodo:fetch
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
