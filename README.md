# I18nWigodo (I18n with Google Docs)

This gem offers a simple way of having cloud stored translations for
your Rails app.

Just create a new spreadsheet in Google Docs and make it world readable.
This makes integration of the gem easier since no credentials and
authentication mechanisms for Google are needed.

If this is a security concern for you, either this gem is not for you,
or you can revoke public read access to the document whenever you are
not syncing your translations.

You can share your document with write access to your translator.

To fetch new translations, run

```sh
rake wigodo:fetch
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'i18n_wigodo'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install i18n-wigodo
